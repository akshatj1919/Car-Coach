Engine|The engine is the heart of a car. Common types include:
• Petrol engines – smoother, higher revving, lower cost to maintain.
• Diesel engines – more torque and fuel-efficient, ideal for long drives.
• Hybrid engines – combine petrol and electric motors for better economy.
• CNG/LPG – compressed or liquefied gas fuels. Cheaper and cleaner, but need regular tank checks.

Cylinders|Engines have cylinders where combustion happens. More cylinders mean smoother power but more fuel use.
• 3-cylinder – efficient and compact, used in small cars.
• 4-cylinder – most common, good balance of power and economy.
• 5-cylinder – rare, smooth and torquey.
• 6-cylinder (V6, inline-6) – refined performance engines.
• 8-cylinder (V8) – used in sports and luxury cars for high power.
Configurations include inline, V-type and flat (boxer)arrangements.

Transmission|The transmission sends engine power to the wheels.
• Manual – driver controls clutch and gears.
• AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) – automated clutch, cheaper auto option.
• CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) – smooth, gearless feel, good for city driving.
• Torque Converter – traditional automatic, smooth but less efficient.
• DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission) – very fast shifts, used in performance cars.

Engine Oil|Lubricates engine parts to reduce wear. 
Types:
• Mineral oil – basic, inexpensive and shorter lifespan.
• Semi-synthetic – balance of cost and protection.
• Fully synthetic – best protection and  longer service life.
Oil grades (For example- 5W-30, 10W-40) indicate viscosity for cold and hot conditions.

Fuel Types|Fuel choice affects performance and emissions.
• Petrol (Regular 91 RON) – standard grade in Australia.
• Premium (95 or 98 RON) – for performance engines, better resistance.
• E10/E20 – ethanol blended fuels (10–20% ethanol) used in many modern cars.
• Diesel – high energy fuel for torque and efficiency.
• Power fuels – marketed blends with cleaning additives.

Brakes|Brakes slow and stop the car using friction.
• Drum brakes – cheaper, used on rear wheels of smaller cars.
• Disc brakes – better cooling and performance, standard on modern cars.
• Carbon-ceramic brakes – used in sports cars, handle high heat, very expensive.
Brake pads and rotors wear out and must be replaced periodically.

Tyres|Tyres connect your car to the road — they affect grip, comfort, and safety.
• Summer tyres – best grip in warm, dry conditions.
• Winter tyres – special rubber for cold or snowy roads.
• All-season tyres – balance of performance in all weather.
• All-terrain (A/T) and mud-terrain (M/T) – for off the road use.
Reading tyre size example: 205/55 R16 = width/profile/rim size.
Speed rating (For example- H, V) shows max safe speed. Replace tyres every 40,000–50,000 km or when tread depth <1.6 mm.

ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)|Prevents wheels from locking during hard braking, allowing steering control while stopping quickly. Standard in all modern vehicles.

Suspension|Suspension absorbs road bumps for stability and comfort.
• Coil spring – simple and reliable, most common type.
• Air suspension – uses airbags and compressors for adjustable ride height.
• Leaf or torsion bar – used in commercial or older vehicles.
Well-tuned suspension improves ride comfort and handling.

ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)|Technology that assists the driver to reduce accidents.
Levels (0–5):
• Level 0 – no automation.
• Level 1 – basic assist (cruise control).
• Level 2 – partial automation (lane and distance assist).
• Level 3 – conditional self driving (rare).
• Level 4/5 – full automation (not yet legal).
Common ADAS: lane departure warning, adaptive cruise, emergency braking, blind spot detection.

Drive Trains|Describes how power is sent to the wheels.
• FWD (Front-Wheel Drive) – light and efficient, most small cars.
• RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive) – better balance, used in sports cars.
• AWD (All-Wheel Drive) – power to all wheels for stability and grip.
• 4x4 – selectable four-wheel drive for off-road capability.

Warning Symbols|Dashboard warning lights tell you about the car’s health.
• Red lights – serious issues (oil pressure, brake fault, overheating).
• Amber lights – caution (check engine, low fuel, ABS).
• Green/blue – information (headlights on, cruise control).
Check the owner’s manual for exact meanings.

AdBlue|Used in modern diesel vehicles with SCR systems to reduce NOx emissions.
It’s a urea based liquid stored in a separate tank. Low AdBlue levels trigger a dashboard warning and can prevent starting if empty.

Service Intervals|Regular servicing keeps your car reliable and safe.
Typical checks every 10,000 km or 6 months:
• Engine oil and filter change
• Air and cabin filter replacement
• Brake, coolant, and tyre inspection
• Battery and lights check
Major services (40,000–60,000 km) may include spark plugs, transmission oil, and fuel filter replacement.

Seatbelts|Primary safety feature that restrains passengers during sudden stops or crashes.
Modern systems include pre-tensioners and load limiters. Always wear your seatbelt.

Mirrors|Proper mirror adjustment removes blind spots.
Types:
• Rear-view mirror – shows traffic behind.
• Side mirrors – show left/right lanes; adjust so you barely see your own car.
Some cars have auto dimming and blind-spot indicators.

Battery|Provides power to start the engine and run electrical systems.
• Lead-acid batteries – standard type, 3–5 year life.
• AGM or EFB – advanced versions for start-stop systems.
Keep terminals clean and replace the battery if starting becomes weak.

Airbags|Inflate instantly during collisions to cushion occupants. 
Modern cars have front, side, curtain, and knee airbags. Airbags work best with seatbelts.

Cooling System|Keeps the engine from overheating using coolant circulated through the radiator.
Check coolant levels regularly; overheating can cause severe engine damage.

Exhaust System|Carries gases from the engine safely out the rear. 
Includes catalytic converter and muffler to reduce emissions and noise. 
Any leaks can be dangerous.

Fuel Efficiency Tips|Keep tyres inflated, drive smoothly, avoid idling, and service regularly. 
Aggressive driving and overloading drastically reduce fuel economy.
