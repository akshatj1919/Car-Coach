Engine|The engine is the heart of a car. Types:
Petrol engines -higher revving and costs less to maintain.
Diesel engines -more torque and fuel-efficient.
Hybrid engines -combine petrol and electric motors for better economy.
CNG/LPG -compressed or liquefied gas fuels. Cheaper and cleaner, but need regular tank checks.

Cylinders|Engines have cylinders where combustion of fuel is done. More cylinders mean smoother power delivery but it burns more fuel.
• 3-cylinder -efficient and small in size mostly used in small cars.
• 4-cylinder -most commonly found it have good balance of power and economy.
• 5-cylinder -rare to found in a car they are smooth and torquey.
• 6-cylinder (V6, inline 6) -very linear performance and they are known to be most reliable engines.
• 8-cylinder (V8) -used in sports and luxury cars for high power.
They have different configurations including inline, V-type and flat(boxer) arrangements.

Transmission|The transmission sends engine power to the wheels.
• Manual -driver controls clutch and gears.
• AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) -automated clutch and they are cheaper alternative to automatic transmission.
• CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) -smooth, gearless(belt operated) recommended for city usage.
• Torque Converter -traditional automatic they are smooth but less efficient.
• DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission) -very fast shifts mostly used in performance cars.

Engine Oil|Lubricates engine parts to reduce wear. 
Types:
• Mineral oil -not expensive and shorter lifespan.
• Semi-synthetic -balance of cost and protection.
• Fully synthetic -best protection and  longer service life.
Oil grades (For example-5W-30, 10W-40) indicate viscosity of oil which is basically for different conditions(Hot and cold).

Fuel Types|Fuel choice affects performance and emissions.
• Petrol (Regular 91 RON) -standard grade in Australia.
• Premium (95 or 98 RON) -for performance engines.
• E10/E20 -ethanol blended fuels (10-20% ethanol) used in many modern cars.
• Diesel -More energy fuel for torque and efficiency.
• Power fuels -contains cleaning additives.

Brakes|Brakes slow and stop the car using friction.
• Drum brakes -cheaper option used on rear wheels of cheaper cars.
• Disc brakes -better cooling and performance mostly standard on modern cars.
• Carbon-ceramic brakes -used in sports cars can handle high temperature but very expensive.
Brake pads and rotors must be replaced when needed.

Tyres|Direct connect to road — they provide grip and comfort.
• Summer tyres -best used in summeror in dry conditions.
• Winter tyres -special rubber for cold or snowy roads.
• All-season tyres -suitable for all weather.
• All-terrain (A/T) and mud-terrain (M/T) -for off the road use.
Reading tyre size example: 205/55 R16 = width/profile/rim size.
Speed rating (like H, V) shows max safe speed. Replace tyres every 30,000-60,000 km or when tread depth becomes less than recommended.

ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)| Electronic brain of bracks which prevents wheels from locking during hard braking. Gives margin to correct the stear.

Suspension|Also known as Springs or coils which is used to increase comfort.
• Coil spring -simple and most commonly found.
• Air suspension -uses airbags in suspension and they can also adjust ride height.
• Leaf or torsion bar -used in commercial or older vehicles.

ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)|Tech for assisting driver using cameras or radar systems.
Levels (0-5):
• Level 0 -no automation.
• Level 1 -basic assist (cruise control).
• Level 2 -partial automation (lane and distance assist).
• Level 3 -conditional self driving (rare).
• Level 4/5 -full automation (not yet legal).
It includes lane departure warning, adaptive cruise and emergency braking.

Drive Trains|Drive shaft connecting transmission to wheel.
• FWD (Front-Wheel Drive) -only front wheels recives all power mostly found small cars.
• RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive) -Rear wheels gets power used in sports cars or luxury cars.
• AWD (All-Wheel Drive) -power to all wheels for stability and grip.
• 4x4 -conversion possible from rear wheel drive to four wheel drive for off road usage.

Warning Symbols|Dashboard warning lights tell you about the car’s health.
• Red lights -serious issues (oil pressure, brake fault, overheating).
• Amber lights -caution (check engine, low fuel, ABS).
• Green/blue -information (headlights on, cruise control).
Check the owner’s manual for exact meanings.

AdBlue|Used in modern diesel vehicles to contro emission.
It’s a urea stored in a separate tank. It basically uses to clear catback system and its filter. 

Service Intervals|Regular servicing can make your car last long and run smoothly.
Most cars have 10,000 km or 1 year as interval:
• Engine oil, Engine oil filter change
• Air and cabin filter replacement
• Brake and coolant
Some services includes spark plugs, transmission oil, and fuel filter replacement.

Seatbelts|Primary safety feature and the first thing every one should do after getting in the car.
Always wear your seatbelt.

Mirrors|Proper mirror adjustment are necessary as they give a good picture of what is going on the road.
• Rear view mirror.
• Side mirrors.
If adjusted correctly there would be no blind spot.

Battery|Provides electric power to start the engine.
Keep both the terminals clean and replace the battery if needed or afetr every 3 years.

Airbags|Cushons installed in the interior for making passengers safe in any accident. Airbags work best with seatbelts. Some cars comes with exterior airbags for pedestrians.

Cooling System|Keeps the engine from overheating.
Coolant is circulated through the radiator to make the engine cooler.
